## **Introduction**
The Economic Analysis App is a comprehensive tool designed to evaluate the overall economy based on several key macroeconomic indicators. The app uses Interest Rate, Inflation Rate, GDP Growth, Unemployment Rate, Stock Market Growth, and Public Debt as inputs in order to provide an in-depth analysis of the economy's current state and future prospects.

This README file explains the methodology behind each of these macroeconomic indicators and how they contribute to the overall analysis.

## **Methodology**
The following subsections describe the methodology used for each macroeconomic indicator and their role in the economic analysis.

### **Interest Rate**
The interest rate, usually set by a country's central bank, is a crucial the overall economic analysis. The app considers both short-term and long-term interest rates to evaluate the cost of borrowing and the return on savings. Higher interest rates can signal a tightening monetary policy, which may lead to slower economic growth, while lower interest rates can stimulate economic growth by encouraging borrowing and investment.

The app analyzes historical interest rate data and compares it with current rates to identify trends and potential future changes in monetary policy.

### **Inflation Rate**
Inflation is the rate at which the general price level of goods and services in an economy is increasing over time. A moderate level of inflation is generally considered healthy for an economy, while high inflation can erode purchasing power and create uncertainty, and deflation can lead to reduced spending and economic stagnation.

The app uses the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or other relevant inflation indices to calculate the inflation rate. It compares current and historical inflation rates to determine the economy's inflationary environment and its potential impact on future growth.

### **GDP Growth**
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth is a measure of the increase in the value of goods and services produced by an economy over time. The app calculates GDP growth on a quarterly or annual basis, adjusting for inflation, to provide a real GDP growth figure.

By analyzing historical GDP growth data, the app identifies trends and cyclical patterns, which can help forecast future economic growth and inform decision-making.

### **Unemployment Rate**
The unemployment rate represents the percentage of the labor force that is actively seeking employment but is unable to find a job. A low unemployment rate indicates a healthy labor market and economic growth, while high unemployment can signal economic stagnation or recession.

The app analyzes the unemployment rate in the context of the overall economic environment, taking into account factors such as demographics, labor force participation, and job creation. It also compares current and historical unemployment rates to determine trends and potential future labor market conditions.

### **Stock Market Growth**
Stock market growth is an indicator of the overall performance of a country's publicly traded companies and investor sentiment. The app uses major stock market indices, such as the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, or other relevant indices, to track stock market performance over time.

By analyzing historical stock market data and comparing it with current market conditions, the app can identify trends and potential future movements in the stock market. This information can provide insight into the broader economy and the prospects for growth and investment.

### **Public Debt**
Public debt is the total amount of money owed by a government to its creditors. A moderate level of public debt is generally considered sustainable, while high levels of debt can lead to increased borrowing costs, reduced fiscal flexibility, and potential credit rating downgrades.

The app examines the public debt-to-GDP ratio, which measures the size of a country's debt relative to its GDP. By comparing current and historical debt levels, the app can assess the sustainability of a government's fiscal policies and the potential impact on the economy.
